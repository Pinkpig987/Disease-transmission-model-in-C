# Disease-transmission-model-in-C
This project is from the final project of the data structures course created by our group.

1. Why did we choose this topic?
We chose this topic not only because we wanted to focus on a real-world issue, but also because the threat of COVID-19 has left a deep impact on peopleâ€™s minds, both in Taiwan and globally. Therefore, through this topic, we aimed to gain a deeper understanding and analysis of the issue, while applying the graph concepts we learned in class. The program for this project was initially based on the disease transmission model provided by ChatGPT. We primarily used the disease transmission model as the foundation, defining various parameters, transmission rates, and implementing different pandemic prevention policies. Additionally, we set the initial number of infected individuals to 77,744 to correspond with the population of the West Central Dist, Tainan City, simulating a more realistic scenario.
